# panda-landing-page
My own HTML landing page made from scratch to mimic layout of The Odin Project: Foundations: Landing Page.

Skills practiced:
- Use git and command line to create, manage, and navigate files.
- Write helpful commits and commit frequently.
- Use GitHub to publically share my work.
- Write basic HTML elements, including images and font attribute changes.
- Organize HTML elements using CSS flexbox and box model.
- Use nested flexboxes to create a multi-sectioned page.
- Practice niche CSS properties like border-radius for a polished look.
